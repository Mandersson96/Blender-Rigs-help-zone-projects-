People of different experience helping me with Blender Projects

Description below!

Here is my first Blender character rig. I know, it's not that great but I'm learning and I'm happy with my first sorta-kinda humanoid character I've creaated.

Auto IK rig is on and parenting works fairly well with the arms but not so much for the legs and I can't figure the reason. 

I've tried to undo all that I've done to the legs so that it's a fresh start.

Hoping someone can help me on this rigging project as I'm still learning and I'd love to have it 
fully rigged but understand how and why and what my underlying problems were to fix it for next time!

Thanks for all the help in advance!
